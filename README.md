# FlexibleParser        

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/varocarbas/FlexibleParser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/varocarbas/FlexibleParser)

FlexibleParser is a multi-purpose .NET parsing library based upon the following ideas:

- Intuitive, adaptable and easy to use.
- Pragmatic, but aiming for the maximum accuracy and correctness.
- Overall compatible and easily automatable. 
- Formed by independent DLLs managing specific situations.

## Parts

At the moment, FlexibleParser is formed by the following independent parts:

[UnitParser](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/blob/master/all_readme/UnitParser.md) ([C# code](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/tree/master/all_code/UnitParser/Source) and [all_binaries](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/tree/master/all_binaries)/UnitParser.dll). It allows to easily deal with a wide variety of situations involving units of measurement.
Among its most salient features are: [user-defined exception triggering](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/blob/master/all_readme/UnitParser.md#general-rules) and [gracefully managing numeric values of any size](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/blob/master/all_readme/UnitParser.md#numeric-support).
